                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        Tub cutouts or tub cuts are used to convert a tub into a shower. There are models of tub cuts that allow this to become a permanent change while others give you the option to alternate between using a shower and a bathtub.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                        When installed in your accessible bathroom in Canada, these tub cuts allow the bathroom to remove one section of the tub wall. This makes it easier for people to step into the shower.

                        To provide additional support and stability, many choose to install grab bars in accessible bathrooms. These are strategically placed near toilets, showers, and even bathrooms to help people maintain their balance when getting up, sitting down, or moving around. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                        Grab bars are always made from durable materials like stainless steel. Our products here at Home2stay come in different sizes, styles, and configurations for your bathroom.

                        To provide more access for those using wheelchairs and canes, an accessible bathroom in Canada should have barrier-free options. These give your bathrooms more space by taking out physical barriers and obstacles that people may encounter.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        In an accessible bathroom, sinks are installed at a lower height and have different features to make them more convenient to use.
                        This is done by providing more knee clearing and a deeper basin so that wheelchair users can easily roll up to the sink. They may also have a single-lever faucet. You may choose to add anti-scald devices to regulate the water temperature.

                        An important feature of an accessible bathroom in Canada is an ADA-compliant faucet. These meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
                        Some of its notable features are touchless operations where sinks have motion sensors to turn on and off. They should also have insulated pipes to prevent accidental burns from hot pipes under the sink.
